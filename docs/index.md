## Welcome

This page contains important information about the [Seventh BSD-qBio Boot Camp](https://biosciences.uchicago.edu/content/mbl-bootcamp), which will be held online from Sept 9-15, 2021.

More than 100 incoming graduate students from the different programs in the [Division of Biological Sciences](https://biosciences.uchicago.edu) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu) will participate.

On this page, you find the instructions on how to **prepare your laptop** so that it's ready for the boot camp.

You should also **take a look at the data and the code** we will explore in the workshops and tutorials.

You can see the **schedule** of the boot camp, and find the contact information for the directors.

## Schedule

The qBio boot camp will be, as the name implies, quite intense. We are going to have **Tutorials** (short primers to a certain topic) and **Workshops** (discipline-specific, hands-on activities).

Here's the [general schedule](https://github.com/jnovembre/BSD-QBio7/raw/master/schedule/GeneralSchedule.pdf).

You can also browse the schedule [by group](https://github.com/jnovembre/BSD-QBio7/tree/master/schedule).

## Computing tutorials

To accommodate the diverse background of our students, we have created two tracks for the computing tutorials.

*   Basic Computing I and II: dedicated to new users who are not familiar with `R` or programming in general. It will guide students step-by-step, introducing the `R` syntax and showing how to write well-organized code for data analysis and scientific research.
*   Advanced Computing I and II: dedicated to experienced `R` users, thesee will focus on manipulating large data sets, plotting, and the use of regular expressions.

**You will need to decide which track's sessions to attend on Day 1 of the Bootcamp**.  After Day 1, you will move throught the material in teams with mixed skill levels.  **Choose which track to join for Day 1 by consulting the lecture materials and making sure that the content is at the right level for you**:

*   Basic Computing I ([web](https://github.com/jnovembre/BSD-QBio7/blob/master/tutorials/basic_computing_1/basic_computing_1.Rmd), [pdf](https://github.com/jnovembre/BSD-QBio7/raw/master/tutorials/basic_computing_1/basic_computing_1.pdf))
*   Basic Computing II ([web](https://github.com/jnovembre/BSD-QBio7/blob/master/tutorials/basic_computing_2/basic_computing_2.Rmd), [pdf](https://github.com/jnovembre/BSD-QBio7/raw/master/tutorials/basic_computing_2/basic_computing_2.pdf))
*   Advanced Computing: **Special preparation for Advanced Computing:** You should work through the Advanced Computing preparatory material before the session begins. [Link to preparatory material](https://github.com/jnovembre/BSD-QBio7/blob/master/tutorials/advanced_computing/tutorial/advanced_computing.pdf)


## Preparing your laptop

We are going to start working right away. Therefore, it is very important you **prepare your laptop** for the boot camp before the first session on Thursday. This will take you about one hour, so schedule accordingly.

You will work on your laptop all day long. **If you don't have a laptop, please contact the course directors immediately**.

### Installation of `R` and `R` packages

*   **Install R**: go to [this page](https://cran.rstudio.com/), download the file corresponding to your platform, and install it. (Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZbjUEg4a1g) explaining how to install R and RStudio in Windows; [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rp9bkc68y0) for Mac OSX)

*   **Install RStudio**: once installed R, go to [this page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), download the installer for your operating system (section **Installers for Supported Platforms**), and install the software.

*   Once installed R and RStudio, open RStudio and **install the following packages**:

    *   devtools
    *   tidyverse
    *   knitr
    *   workflowr
    *   ggthemes
    *   cowplot
    *   Rtsne
    *   BiocManager
    *   ggseqlogo
    *   pheatmap

    You can find instructions on how to install `R` packages in RStudio [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RWb5U3X-T8).

* **Other packages** After the package installs above, two more sets of the packages need to be installed using special installers within `R`. First, open Rstudio and in the Console type `library(devtools)`, hit Return (or Enter) and then `install_github("jdstorey/qvalue")`. This will install the library `qvalue` that is needed for one of the tutorials.  Second, type `library(BiocManager)` hit Return (or Enter) and then,
`BiocManager::install(c("airway","Rsamtools","Rsubread","DESeq2","vsn", "org.Hs.eg.db","GenomicFeatures", "clusterProfiler"))`.  This should install 8 libraries that will be used for the RNAseq workshop.

* **UNIX Emulator**: If you are using Windows, you need to install a UNIX emulator. We suggest downloading the version control software `Git`, because it ships with a small emulator (`Git Bash`). Simply go to [this page](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the instructions.

* **Git**
    * **Join GitHub** click [here](https://education.github.com/pack/join) and make sure you use your uchicago email to get free tools.
    * **Download GitKraken** click [here](https://support.gitkraken.com/how-to-install)

## Downloading the data

It is very important to download the data **before the workshop**, as the files are quite large. (Warning! The repo is >200MB!)
All you need to do is to download the repository containing all the boot camp lectures and data.
We will download the repository using GitKraken (you can alternatively use command-line `git` if you are already familiar with it).

1. Open GitKraken (see download link above)
2. Login with your GitHub account (see instructions and link above)
3. "Clone a Repo" (in File menu)
4. "Clone with URL"
5. "Where to Clone:" Browse to the folder in which you want to keep your repository (your home directory is fine)
6. "URL": Paste: `https://github.com/jnovembre/BSD-QBio7.git`
7. "Clone the Repo!" (this step will take a few minutes)

Now if you go to the folder you chose in step 5, you'll see the repository!

## Programming Challenges

During the boot camp, the 12 groups of students will compete through 5 programming challenges. Here are the links to the webpages where the groups should post their solutions (one answer per group, please):

* Submit your answer to [Programming Challenge 1 (Basic Programming I)](https://forms.gle/w93jnanysf8L8BXn9)
* Submit your answer to [Programming Challenge 2 (Basic Programming II)](https://forms.gle/pK13yMf3ac2pcJCh8)
* Sumbit your ansser to [Advanced Programming Challenge](https://forms.gle/QQgAMA88a7Jj9KtG7)
* Submit your answer for the tutorial on [Defensive Programming](https://forms.gle/DGGjcNQA5jFtBtVd7)
* Submit your answer for the tutorial on [Data Visualization](https://forms.gle/tvTZrn79bC8y7cPb9)
* Submit your answer for the tutorial on [Stats for large data](https://forms.gle/DrummMdTUbuCdTsQ9)
